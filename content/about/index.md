Hi there, Vince here. My real name is Quyền. It's tricky to pronounce for folks who don't speak Vietnamese so I decided to pick a nickname 15 years ago. [Guess where it came from](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vincent_Valentine). 

Professional, I'm a Cloud Customer Engineer / Sales Engineer at [@google](https://cloud.google.com) ☁️. I look after Enterprise customers in the UK Entertainment (Gaming & Gambling) sector. My specialisation is [Application Modernisation]((https://cloud.google.com/solutions/application-modernization)) - covering modern application development, CI/CD, containerisation/Kubernetes and more. All in all, to help businesses build products better, faster and cheaper. However, during my time at Google, I got a chance to [get hands on](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/baptism-by-fire.asp) with several complex Data transformation programmes. Now (I think) I know what I’m talking about when it comes to Data Engineering, Analytics & Machine Learning 🤔. 

Outside of work, I co-host [@unlock fm](https://unlockfm.com) 🎙 - a podcast series exploring the stories, career, philosophies, tools & tactics of young Vietnamese around the world. It started as a small project but as of March 2022, It’s been featured on Spotify and Apple's Top 20 Podcasts in Vietnam and ranked #1 on Apple's Top Careers Podcast in Vietnam - with 15,000+ monthly listeners. 

There’s no perfect way to assess someone’s personality or characteristics but [PrinciplesYou](https://principlesyou.com/home) is the most insightful & accurate test I’ve come across. My Archetypes are the [Orchestrator, the Coach & the Planner](https://principlesyou.com/share/nqZtLO9HsBVqZ-k). 
Nonetheless, in my own words, my strengths are:
* Bringing order to chaos / strategic planning
* Bias for action / high practicality 
* Learning & organising knowledge
* Trusting in and unlocking people’s potential 
* Building & facilitating authentic connection / appreciating individuality

What I’m not so great at
* Creativity
* Flexibility
* Being content with the status quo (in life / work / social groups..)

What I value
* Family & friends
* Compassion
* Authenticity & honesty
* Good design
